# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python

This is a basic implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. Players take turns to mark 'X' or 'O' on a 3x3 grid, and the game continues until one player wins or the board is filled, resulting in a tie.

## How to Play

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Players are prompted to enter the row and column where they want to place their symbol ('X' or 'O').
3. The game alternates between players until there is a winner or a tie.

## Code Overview

### `print_board(board)`

- Function to display the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe board.

### `check_winner(board)`

- Function to check if there is a winner by examining rows, columns, and diagonals.

### `is_board_full(board)`

- Function to check if the board is full, resulting in a tie.

### `tic_tac_toe()`

- Main function that orchestrates the game.
- Initializes an empty 3x3 board and starts with 'X' player.
- Continues the game loop until there is a winner or a tie.
- Handles user input, updates the board, and switches players.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Copy the code into a Python environment or save it as a `.py` file.
3. Run the script.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game.

## Notes

- The game checks for a winner or a tie after each move.
- If a player attempts to choose an already occupied spot, they are prompted to try again.

Have fun playing Tic-Tac-Toe! Feel free to customize or enhance the code to suit your preferences.
